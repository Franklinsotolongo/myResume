                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a project manager with over eight years of experience leading cross-functional initiatives in healthcare, IT, and real estate. At Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, I manage projects like the Sylvester Data Portal (SDP), a multi-omics research platform, and the Cancer Center Support Grant Renewal (P30 CCSG), where I streamlined documentation workflows using Microsoft Intranet, SharePoint, and Power Automate.  With certifications in project management and Lean Six Sigma, along with a master’s in health administration and project management, I specialize in process optimization, risk management, and workflow efficiency. I use agile methodologies to improve operations, reduce bottlenecks, and drive impactful results.

                    <p>
                        Sylvester Thorough Cancer Center now provides a central hub that simplifies data access, improves data management and increases translational research. It comprehensively integrates many clinical, genomic, as well as research datasets; this greatly supports precision medicine along with strong data-directed decision-making. This project leverages SQL databases, Python, R, REDCap, AWS and high-performance computing, along with visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. In my role as Project Manager, I manage more than 38 projects, guaranteeing efficient workflows, compliance and alignment with project plans. Lean principles improved my grant renewal efficiency and issue resolution and this guaranteed smooth research data integration.

                        The Cancer Center Support Grant Renewal (P30 CCSG) was a mission-critical project supporting the NCI grant renewal for Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, focusing on streamlining the documentation collection, validation, and submission process. The initiative involved developing a comprehensive attachment workflow to ensure seamless integration of essential materials for the P30 Grant NCI Site Visit. Utilizing Microsoft Intranet via Azure, SharePoint Pages, Power Automate, and a loop tracking system for real-time data requests, I led the creation of electronic binders, built a dedicated repository site for data management, and implemented a tracking system to enhance accessibility, compliance, and efficiency. This workflow significantly improved document organization, ensured seamless submission, and supported the center’s strategic objectives.
